# My_JAVA_Journey
# 💻 My Java Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java corner on GitHub! I'm **JAYASRI S**, an AI & Data Science undergrade passionate about building strong programming foundations and backend logic using **Java**.

## 🚀 Why Java?
Although my domain is rooted in Python and AI tools, I was drawn to Java for its:
- Robust **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** features
- Strong **type safety**
- Use in **industry-level applications** and backend systems

## 📘 What I’ve Learned So Far:
- ✅ Core Java: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- ✅ DSA with Java: Arrays, Strings, Recursion, LinkedLists, Sorting Algorithms 
- ✅ Exception Handling & Code Optimization
- ✅ IDE: VS Code & IntelliJ, Version Control using Git

## 🧠 Problem Solving Practice:
- Solving DSA problems on platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**
- Focused on improving logic, debugging, and code readability

## 🛠️ Projects in Progress:
- 🔹 Java mini-projects to apply concepts in real-world scenarios
- 🔹 Backend logic simulations using Java

## 📍 Goals:
- Build strong backend development skills with Java
- Integrate Java with web technologies
- Prepare for **placement interviews** with a solid understanding of Java internals
